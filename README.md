# QueueManager
Minecraft version 1.20.1
Requires Fabric API  
## How to
### Use
Paste the .jar file of the plugin to your rusherhack plugins folder.  
Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/GabiRP/QueueManager/tree/rusher#discord-bot) to setup the discord bot.  
Enable the module through RusherHack's gui.  
The bot will notify you when:
- You disconnect from the server while on queue
- You are close to or have finished the queue
### Discord bot
First, Enable Discord Developer Mode in your client..
[Here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started#step-1-creating-an-app)  
Once you have it, run the C# application, wait for it to close and paste your token into the generated ``config.json`` file.  
You will also have to create a discord server (and invite the bot to it)
Right Click the server icon in your vertical server bar, and click "Copy Server ID". Paste it to a notepad
Then Right Click your user account, and copy your user id. Paste it to a notepad
then paste the server's id and your own user id into the ``config.json`` file.  
Make sure you have DMs enabled for that server
### Build
Search it on google, i'm too lazy to explain it here.
