## How to
### Build
Search it on google, i'm too lazy to explain it here.  
Before building the C# project, go to the file Bot.cs and edit the two id's. Change the first one to a discord server you have created and the second one change it to your discord user id
### Discord bot
[Here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started#step-1-creating-an-app)  
Once you have it, run the C# application, wait for it to close and paste your token into the generated ``config.json`` file.
